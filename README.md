# Horiseon-demo
A website to demonstrate an on-the-job ticket challenge. Goal was to improve the source code for accessibility and structure. 

## User Story: 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## The acceptance criteria is the following:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements

* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* WHEN I view the icon and image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes

* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order

* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
