# Horiseon-demo
A website to demonstrate an on-the-job ticket challenge. Goal was to improve the source code for accessibility and structure.

**Note**, this is a UCR bootcamp assignment! Credits to UCR bootcamp for providing material such as source code and Readme file.

We were given a index.html, Style.css, and a few images to complete this activity. 

## User Story: 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## The acceptance criterias are the following:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements

* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* WHEN I view the icon and image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes

* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order

* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Content
I want to modify the source code to have proper accessibility without changing the website structure and style. The biggest thing that came to my attention is how I should **optimize** this website. These were my thought process in completing this.

* First, I wanted to know more about was the services this website wants to provide. The search optimization, online management, and social media marketing were the three services that the website was providing. I google each term to get a better understanding of what they are and do. Once my research was finished, I inserted a title that fits the overall aspect of the website with consideration of search engine algorithms. 

* Second, I wanted to find HTML elements that closely matches the elements within. The source code only had **Div** classes which doesn't tell me what kind of content it is. I researched different HTML elements and inserted the most appropriate ones that fits the elements.
